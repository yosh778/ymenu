With minpspsdk having so many dependency issues depending on the version, here's a quick guide explaining how to compile with it.


= Compiling =

  * To compile with minpspsdk, first get a copy of *[http://www.jetdrone.com/minpspw minpspsdk 0.10.0]*, as most other versions seem to throw dependency errors.
  * Uninstall all existing minpspsdk version, and install version 0.10.0
  * In common.h, make sure one of #define TN_CFW / #define VHBL defines is uncommented, to choose one compile mode
  * Compile with command "make 3xx" in the "[...]/project/yMenu/" folder
  * Congrats ! You should now have successfully compiled yMenu
